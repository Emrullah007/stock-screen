‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Note About Backend Service**
```
The backend service is hosted on a free tier and goes to sleep after periods of inactivity. 
When accessing the application for the first time or after inactivity:
‚Ä¢ Please allow up to 10 minutes for the backend to "wake up"
‚Ä¢ Initial requests might take longer to respond
‚Ä¢ Subsequent requests will be much faster once the backend is active
```

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- React 18
- Material-UI (MUI)
- Chart.js for data visualization
- React Router for navigation
- Vite for build tooling

### Backend
- FastAPI
- OpenAI/Azure OpenAI for AI analysis
- yfinance for stock data
- Python 3.8+

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 16+
- Python 3.8+
- OpenAI API key or Azure OpenAI credentials
- NewsAPI key for sentiment analysis

## Installation

### Backend Setup

#### Python Installation (macOS)
1. Using Homebrew (recommended):
```bash
# Install Homebrew first if you don't have it
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

# Install Python
brew install python
```

2. Verify Python installation:
```bash
python3 --version
```

3. Create and activate the virtual environment:
```bash
# In the backend directory
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

4. Install requirements:
```bash
# Make sure you're in the backend directory and venv is activated
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

# If you encounter any missing package errors, install these packages specifically:
pip install fastapi==0.115.7
pip install "fastapi[all]"
pip install yfinance==0.2.52
pip install openai==1.60.1
pip install aiohttp
```

Note: Make sure to activate the virtual environment (`source venv/bin/activate`) every time you open a new terminal window to work on the backend.

### Frontend Setup
```bash
# In the frontend directory
npm install
```

### Environment Configuration

1. Create a `.env` file in the backend directory:
```env
# OpenAI Configuration (if using OpenAI directly)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here

# Azure OpenAI Configuration (if using Azure OpenAI)
AZURE_API_KEY=your_azure_api_key_here
AZURE_ENDPOINT=https://your-resource-name.openai.azure.com
AZURE_MODEL_NAME=your-deployed-model-name

# Other APIs
NEWS_API_KEY=your_newsapi_key_here

# Security
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here
```

2. Create a `.env.local` file in the frontend directory:
```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8003/api/v1
```

## Development

### Start the Backend Server
```bash
# Make sure you're in the backend directory and venv is activated
cd backend
source venv/bin/activate

# Start the server
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8003
```

The backend server will be available at:
- API: http://localhost:8003
- API Documentation: http://localhost:8003/docs
- Alternative API Documentation: http://localhost:8003/redoc
- Health Check: http://localhost:8003/health

### Start the Frontend Development Server
```bash
# In a new terminal window, navigate to the frontend directory
cd frontend

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

The frontend application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

Note: Both servers need to be running simultaneously for the application to work properly. Use separate terminal windows for the backend and frontend servers.

## Deployment

### Backend Deployment (Render)

1. Create a new Web Service on Render
2. Connect your GitHub repository
3. Configure the service:
   - Build Command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - Start Command: `uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT`
4. Add Environment Variables:
   - All variables from `.env`
   - Set `PORT` to `10000`

### Frontend Deployment (Vercel)

1. Import your GitHub repository to Vercel
2. Configure the project:
   - Framework Preset: Vite
   - Build Command: `npm run build`
   - Output Directory: `dist`
3. Add Environment Variables:
   - `VITE_API_URL`: Your Render backend URL + `/api/v1`
